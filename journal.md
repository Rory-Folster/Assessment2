For Assessment 2, I have been tasked with building my own 'shooping' website using the static generator called 'Jekyll'.
This is not been the most smooth operation but I got there in the end. I have learnt how to use Jekyll and how to remove the Ruby and theme aspect of Jekyll, this allows me to use 
vanilla HTML/CSS which in my opinion is a lot smoother and easier to use than the Ruby/Jekyll coding. I have learnt a lot through this assessment, a few things i have learnt are
how to use favicons, how to use the 'table' tag to set up images in a row so it looks similar to a shopping layout, aswell as how to add the buttons below it and have them sitting nice 
with the image, I have also learnt a lot about css/style tags, previously i was a little confused with the whole css/sstyling aspect of web creation, but i now have a much better understanding
of these parts of web creation. One of the biggest troubles i have had with the HTML/CSS is getting the elements to line up and stay inline together, for example on my home page i was
trying to set up the 4 bug buttons to be inline, like how they are now, but when i first started with the coding i could not get them on the same line, I ended up finding out that i can use
<div class="buttons" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"> and this brings all the the elements within the <div> tag together and on the same line. I used the exact same method with a alot
of elements through out my webpage. I also learnt how to host a Jekyll website and add a custom domain, which in the end was the most smooth part of this Assessment. 

I have learnt these skills as it is a great thing to know how to code and display elements on a website, how you want and how to add different elements and then further manipulate them with
css. I personally don't think that Jekyll was necassary in this task and it just made the tasks over complicated, I spent the longest amount of time doing nothing when i was trying to figure out
how to use Jekyll as it wasn't displaying what i wanted etc. This was because i was using a Jekyll Theme. I didn't know you could remove the theme and as far as i know it wasn't talked about in class.
This was just an assessment pretty much based of self research and had a 'figure it out yourself' feeling. All in all i have learnt a lot from this assessment and a lot about HTML/CSS, but not much about
Jekyll. 

I did a lot of research on Google(how to add certain elements, how to style specific things etc.), I also talked to my friend who is a Website Developer currently and he gave me a lot of helpful things
to research. I would say 95% of this assessment was based off self research and how to use Jekyll.

To further understand HTML/CSS I will continue reading my Javascript & JQuerry book, as well as googleing different things about HTML/CSS. I was also pondering the idea of creating a basic project
website that I can upgrade and make it look better part by part as there would be no deadline etc. I am also getting into watching other people who are already great website developers on youtube, and how they
create their website, elements, how to style css etc. HTML/CSS is very well covered on the internet from what I have seen so it is very hard to get genuinely stuck on something withing HTML/CSS.

I'm not sure how practical it would be in the real work to code every single line by hand, as there are wireframe websites etc that will do the hard work for you, I can understand the purpose of this assessment as
it is a great way to see how people are learning and what they have learnt etc. This Assessment in my opinion was a very great little project, apart from the fact that we are forced to use Jekyll, I think that it could 
have been approached better and smoother with the use of Jekyll. 

To fill in any miss-understandings or missed knowledge within HTML/CSS I will continue to search around on google, youtube etc. There are a lot of cool things you can do with Javascript/CSS that make your website look very nice,
I really want to further understand how these two languages work and what the limits are. The CSS I have used in this website is very basic as i wanted to keep it my own work and use minimal Copy/Paste from W3, Stack Overflow etc.

Overall I am pretty happy with how my project turned out, even though I would say its on the basic side, I have learnt a lot of things, specically CSS and Styling.

For Assessment 3, I was tasked with creating a brief for my 'Business' as well as creating javascript code to make a working register and login page that uses the localStorage within the browser. 

When i first looked at the tasks, I thought it would be fairly easy. As i started looking around Google for help and reading about different key words that i can implement, I quickly figured out it wasn't as straight forward as i had initially thought. After searching around and looking a few very complex codes and figuring out what they did, I had a go at creating my own code. I started off with creating the variables using 'document.getElementByID'. I then created a function that would be used for the registration, after i had created that function, I added an onClick function to my button. As i was searching google for further help, i noticed that it is better to use an <input> element, instead of a <button>. After changing the code around in my html and adding input's, I moved onto my login function and getting that to work. Once I was happy with both functions, I added a similar <input> for the login and added my function. As I was testing it, using the localhost tool in VSCode, I noticed that it wasnt using my JavaScript File. As I was becoming frustrated, that a simple task wasn't working, I took a small break and came to the realization that i had never linked my JavaScript file. After linking the file into my HTML Code, it began working as it should and overall I was happy with how it turned out. 
  
I realise that this is not a secure way to create a functioning login page at all, but it was a good learning curve and it was interesting to further understand javascript, compaired to the tasks I was given in SDV502 this was a lot more fun and it was easier to understand what it was doing as it was put into context. I believe a beneficial addition to the Level 5 I.T degree would be to switch around the WEB and SDV classes, as i believe it would be easier to learn JavaScript after using it in a real system like a webpage. 

The reason why I have learnt the skills involved with Assessment 3 are because it's always good to brush up on my javascript, html and css knowledge and revisit some of the old topics that i have learnt about. I can also see localStorage becoming useful int he future if i was to go down the software development path. It is also good to add more functionality to my web page. The hardest part of the website design was creating a completely responsive site.
